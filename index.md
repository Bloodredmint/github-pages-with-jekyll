# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about ...

My journey in the world of coding and other pursuits.

### Dipping my toes in the world of coding.

Being a hard working father of three, learning to code is not the easiest thing to accomplish. Working full time and all hours the god sends really does limit the amount of free time available to me, so attending a course is not an option. Bootcamps are appealing, but the cost of attending one is now getting to be expensive and there are other risks involved too. It would require me to quit my current full time job and still have enough to cover the outgoings of the house as well as the cost of the course. It would also mean looking for a new property closer to said course. So for the time being, I will continue along the self-taught path, using the power of the internet and various distance learning outlets.
